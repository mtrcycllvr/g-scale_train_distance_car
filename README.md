## Data Car

Something of a mess and untested repository of files related to me wanting to build a 'better' track distance car and realized that people are ALSO interested in a scale speedometer that they can see from a distance..  That's where this high sample rate design has the advantage over other two to four magnet per wheel designs.

We can wick the encoder up to max res and find ourselves with 8k pulses (directional via quadrature) per wheel revolution..  INSTANT accurate low speed speedometer calcs.  Well, quickly..
